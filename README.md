## *Secret* gyro/motion gamepad emulation in new version

Now you can use the controller like a gyro gamepad. Gyro aiming together with analog touch stick (needn't press) are supported. Gamepad buttons and sticks are added to key assignment list for mapping to touchpad press (8 directions, center and lower edge), other 5 buttons and 12 motions. For easier control, assign pointer toggle to a button.

To use the gamepad mode, install [ViGEmBus](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus/releases/tag/v1.22.0), edit the file "C:\Program Files\Gear VR Controller\Gear_VR_Controller.dll.config" (default) and restart the app.

Modify to False in the line under:

DefaultStabilizePointerClick

Modify to True in the lines under:

DefaultGameMode

DefaultGameKeyboardMode

DefaultGamePointerMode

DefaultEmulateGamepad

You can also map controller roll, pitch, yaw motions to stick axes or triggers to make it a motion gamepad. Try to adjust motion pointer speed to 1~3 and assign a pointer reset button. Explore more settings if you're interested.

Modify to True in the lines under:

DefaultGamepadUsePitch

DefaultGamepadUseYaw

Some games may work better with keyboard+mouse emulation, or if you want to combine its input with another gamepad, in that case, leave the DefaultEmulateGamepad option to False.

If the game is run as admin, this app also needs to be run as admin, otherwise Windows won't let them work together.
