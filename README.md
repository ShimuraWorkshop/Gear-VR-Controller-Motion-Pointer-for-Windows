## \*Secret\* gyro/motion gamepad emulation in new version

Now you can use the controller like a gyro gamepad. Gyro aiming together with analog touch stick (needn't press) are supported. Gamepad buttons and sticks are added to key assignment list for mapping to touchpad press (8 directions, center and lower edge), other 5 buttons and 12 motions.

To use the gamepad mode, install [ViGEmBus](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus/releases/tag/v1.22.0), edit the file "C:\Program Files\Gear VR Controller\Gear_VR_Controller.dll.config" (default, text editor needs to be run as admin) and restart the app.

Modify to False in the line under:

DefaultStabilizePointerClick

Modify to True in the lines under:

DefaultGameMode
<br>
DefaultGameKeyboardMode
<br>
DefaultGamePointerMode
<br>
DefaultEmulateGamepad

For easier control, assign "Toggle between cursor and pointer mode" to a button, or assign "Pointer temporary on" to the new second action of buttons by modifying the line under any of:

KeyTouchButtonCenter2 / KeyBackButton2 / KeyHomeButton2 / KeyVolumeUpButton2 / KeyVolumeDownButton2 / KeyTouchButton2 / KeyTriggerButton2 / KeyTouchDirectCenter2

You can also map controller roll, pitch, yaw motions to stick axes or triggers to make it a motion gamepad. Try to adjust motion pointer speed to 1~3 and assign a pointer reset button. Explore more settings if you're interested.

Modify to True in the lines under:

DefaultGamepadUsePitch
<br>
DefaultGamepadUseYaw

Some games may work better with keyboard+mouse emulation, or if you want to combine its input with another gamepad, in that case, leave the DefaultEmulateGamepad option to False.

If the game is run as admin, this app also needs to be run as admin, otherwise Windows won't let them work together.

## < The House of the Dead 2: Remake > PC gyro aiming sample config

Config file
[Link](https://www.mediafire.com/file/ca3mrdhr4q8jl0g/Gear_VR_Controller.dll.config_the.house.of.the.dead.2.remake.zip/file)

ViGEmBus not required, update the app to v2.1.12, extract the config to "C:\Program Files\Gear VR Controller\" (default), then assign keys for example:

Trigger: Mouse left button, Back: Enter, Home: Tab, +: F, -: Esc

Touchpad - Center: Mouse right button, West: Q, East: E, South: Pointer temporary off, North: Unassigned

Touchpad (without press) is mapped to WASD by default, you can change it by modifying KeyTouchDirectNorth/East/South/West/Center in the config file (and restarting app, text editor needs to be run as admin) when necessary.

Adjust the motion pointer speed to around 4 in app and switch to motion pointer mode before starting the game, then in game options, set controller to Keyboard/Mouse, aiming stick to Both Sticks, mouse sensitivity to 1.0, crosshair speed to 1.0.

If the game is run as admin, this app also needs to be run as admin, otherwise Windows won't let them work together.

This config file is also suitable for < Panzer Dragoon: Remake >, just change the key assignments to match the game. But the game has forced mouse smoothing, you need to move the controller slowly.

## < RPCS3 > emulator PC lightgun aiming sample config

For lightgun emulation in games like Time Crisis Razing Storm (Time Crisis 4 Arcade Ver, Razing Storm, Deadstorm Pirates)

Use the same config file as < MAME > [Link](https://www.mediafire.com/file/nr93jqt7o9zzsg4/Gear_VR_Controller.dll.config_lightgun.zip/file)

ViGEmBus not required, update the app to v2.1.12, extract the config to "C:\Program Files\Gear VR Controller" (default), assign keys for example:

Trigger: Mouse left button, Back: Mouse right button, Home: Mouse X2 button

Touchpad - West: Mouse middle button, North: Mouse X1 button, South: Pointer reset

In crosshair calibration, press Ctrl-F11 to switch to PS Move mode. Keep in window mode and resize the window as large as possible at the center of the screen while matching the game's aspect ratio (required to align the Windows cursor with the PS Move cursor).

For Time Crisis 4 and Razing Storm, press Trigger to start calibration. Except the center target, you should shoot at a little further than the outermost border of each target to get the correct calibration. For Deadstorm Pirates, press Home+Trigger to start calibration, just shoot at the center of all targets.

Press Touchpad North to retry, or press Touchpad West to confirm, then Touchpad North to go back to title screen. Press Back button to select menu items and start a new game. Make sure the Controller is set to Motion Controller No.7. When necessary, press Ctrl-F11 to switch to gamepad mode to navigate the menu or change settings, then press Ctrl-F11 to switch back to PS Move mode when ready.

After calibration, you can uncheck Show PS Move Cursor in I/O configuration. Optionally hide the Windows cursor by [nomousy](https://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/2083-nomousy-disablehide-your-mouse-pointer-cmd/) ([download](https://www.pconlife.com/download/otherfile/438390/e6bd23aa62d488b7c63344cc59d017a9/)).

If the emulator is run as admin, this app also needs to be run as admin, otherwise Windows won't let them work together.

## Backup of user config

You can backup the user config file for different settings or game profiles. Exit the app first and it's inside a sub-sub folder in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Gear_VR_Controller

<br>

## Hints on low input lag for games and emulators

- Turn on game mode of TV or monitor if available
- Turn on low latency mode or anti-lag of GPU driver
- Keep the controller within good coverage of Bluetooth
